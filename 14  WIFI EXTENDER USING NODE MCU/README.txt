LOW WiFi SIGNAL


Many peoples facing this problem everyday life we can't use internet at its high speed when signal too low

everything need internet. Smart TV, Smart Phone, Laptop, Desktop Computer

But !

One WiFi connection ??????

How can we access the internet at every corner of house (If large house) its not sufficient to cover the range !

Every foot step reduce the signal of WiFi

And its also not good for multi-story Building

So what is the solution of this problem

Solution #

WiFi Repeater !!!!!

Yes, Repeater is the only solution of this problem

A WiFi repeater or extender is used to extend the coverage area of your WiFi network. It works by receiving your existing WiFi signal, amplifying it and then transmitting the boosted signal. With a WiFi repeater you can effectively double the coverage area of your WiFi network - reaching far corners of your home or office, different floors, or even extend coverage to your yard.

But its also to bulky and costly !!!! So what to do ?

Why not make your own WiFi Repeater

We use NODE MCU (IoT) for our this project

What is Node MCU ??

Introduction: The NodeMcu is an open-source firmware and development kit that helps you toPrototype your IOT product within a few Lua script lines.For more details, please visit https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/wiki/...

How to build your own WiFi extender from a cheap ESP8266 WiFi module Notes: It will have slower connection speeds the farther the extender is away from your router, but fast speeds are not necessary for many IoT projects. I needed a cheap way to increase WiFi range so that a IoT snail mail alert device could reach a distant WiFi router to connect to the internet and send notification to my phone. I stumbled upon Martin Ger's WiFi NAT Router firmware for the ESP8266 WiFi module, flashed it onto my $2 ESP-01 WiFi module, and it works quite well. The router my extender connects to only reaches about 20 feet due to a wall, but with the extender plugged in 10 feet to 50 feet away from it, the connection reaches 310 feet
